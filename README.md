Summary: Our project will look into trends in dog ownership and related factors in NYC. Because all dog owners are required to license their dogs in the city, we have comprehensive data on pet dogs in NYC. We will first look at common breeds, names, and overall ownership levels. Then, we will look into ownership characteristics by age, income, and location within the city. We will also connect our main dog dataset to related data like NYC dog bite dataset, data on green spaces, and additional demographics factors such as housing.
