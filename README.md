Summary: Our project will look into trends in dog ownership and related factors in NYC. Because all dog owners are required to license their dogs in the city, we have comprehensive data on pet dogs in NYC. We will first look at common breeds, names, and overall ownership levels. Then, we connect our main dog dataset to related data such as the NYC dog bite dataset and data on green spaces in NYC. Lastly, we will explore additional demographic factors, such as income, that may be related to dog ownership.
