    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the world, dogs are one of the most popular household pets if not the most popular. New York City takes this popularity even further. Anecdotally, sometimes there seem to be more dogs on the street than people, and dog walking businesses are thriving. As three dog lovers living in New York, we aim to study the unique aspects of dog ownership and behaviors in this city. In addition, we hope to investigate the potential relationships between dogs in the city and social factors in the city such as public green space, income, living situations, and mental health.\nSpecifically, we plan to explore insights about the New York City dog population and dog owners. First, we’re interested in geographic and time series trends regarding various aspects of dog ownership such as the following questions: most popular dog breeds, average age of dog at adoption, most popular names in each zip code. Next, we aim to consider macro social factors and how they relate to dog ownership: are dog ownership and income level related? What about age, housing type, mental health status? Finally, our goal is to consider factors of the city and trends in dog ownership to ascertain potential aspects of living in New York City that relate to individuals owning dogs. Some of the questions we have: Do people feel safer with dogs in their home? Would areas with higher crime rates have more dog ownership? Do neighborhoods with more public green space lead to more dog ownership in those areas? Do dog bite rates in neighborhoods deter dog ownership? Are many dogs in New York City adopted or do more people purchase their dogs from breeders? Ultimately, we’re curious about the specific trends in dog ownership in New York City, what social factors may relate to owning a dog, as well as the way living in New York City may affect dog ownership trends.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nLink: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp/about_data\nDescription: Our primary data source will be the NYC Dog Licensing Dataset from NYC Open Data. This data is provided by the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene. The data is collected as part of the DOHMH Dog Licensing System, where all NYC dog owners are required to apply for dog licenses. The data is updated annually and was last updated on February 6th, 2024. Each record represents a unique dog license that was active during the year and contains columns for the animal name, gender, birth year, and breed. We plan to import the data via the downloadable CSV on the NYC Open Data Website.\nThis dataset requires minimal cleansing. However, we may want to define broader categories for the breeds of licensed dogs. For example, we may choose to group these two, “American Pit Bull Terrier/Pit Bull” and “American Pit Bull Mix/ Pit Bull Mix” into one breed “American Pit Bull”.\nLink: https://data.census.gov/table?g=040XX00US36_050XX00US36005,36047&y=2023&d=ACS%201-Year%20Estimates%20Selected%20Population%20Profiles\nDescription: As mentioned in our introduction, we are looking to consider macro social factors and how they may relate to dog ownership. To inform this, we will leverage the robust US Census Bureau Data, filtering by the counties we are interested in - Staten Island, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, New York, Bronx. The Census Bureau collects data through variety of sources, including from respondents directly. It also uses existing data from government agencies and commercial entities. The data is released annually. Each column represents one of our selected counties. Each record represents a different demographic - for example “Median Household Income”. Using the Census Bureau website, we can filter the data and then export to CSV.\nThe dataset also includes a margin of error. Since census data is collected through a sampling method, the dataset provides us with an uncertainty level around the final estimate. Where necessary, we will include this margin of error in our final visualizations.",
