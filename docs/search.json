    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the world, dogs are one of the most popular household pets, if not the most popular. New York City takes this popularity even further. Anecdotally, there sometimes seem to be more dogs on the street than people, and dog walking businesses are thriving. As three dog lovers living in New York, we aim to study the unique aspects of dog ownership and preference in this city. In addition, we hope to investigate the potential relationships between dogs in the city and social factors in the city such as public green space, income, and living situations.\nSpecifically, we plan to explore insights about the New York City dog population and dog owners. First, we’re interested in geographic and time series trends regarding various aspects of dog ownership such as the following questions: most popular dog breeds and most popular names in each zip code. Additionally, we aim to consider macro social factors and how they relate to dog ownership: are dog ownership and income level related? What about age, housing type, mental health status? Finally, our goal is to consider factors of the city and trends in dog ownership to ascertain potential aspects of living in New York City that relate to individuals owning dogs. Some of the questions we have: Do neighborhoods with more public green space lead to more dog ownership in those areas? Do dog bite rates deter dog ownership? Are ownership and family trends by borough related? Ultimately, we’re curious about the specific trends in dog ownership in New York City, what social factors may relate to owning a dog, as well as the way living in New York City may affect dog ownership trends."

This data is provided by the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene. The data is collected as part of the DOHMH Dog Licensing System, where all NYC dog owners are required to apply for dog licenses. The data is updated annually and was last updated on February 6th, 2024. Each record represents a unique dog license that was active during the year and contains columns for the animal name, gender, birth year, and breed. We plan to import the data via the downloadable CSV on the NYC Open Data Website.\nThe data covers licensing data from 2016-19 and 2023-23; it is missing 2020 and 2021, likely due to the COVID pandemic. While this is obviously a shortcoming, we will still be using the data to visualize overall New York City dog trends, as well as trends before and after the pandemic. We will be sure to not draw any inappropriate or presumptive conclusions given that there is a distinct gap in our data.\nThe variables in this dataset require basic cleaning. For the dog name and dog breed variables, we code responses like “Not Provided” and “Unknown” as NA. Also, for some visualizations, we may want to define broader categories for the breeds of licensed dogs. For example, we may choose to group these two, “American Pit Bull Terrier/Pit Bull” and “American Pit Bull Mix/ Pit Bull Mix” into one breed “American Pit Bull”.\n\nSpatial Datasets\n\nLink: (1) NYC ZipCodes at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Modified-Zip-Code-Tabulation-Areas-MODZCTA-/pri4-ifjk/data (2) NYC Open Spaces at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Planimetric-Database-Open-Space-Parks-/g84h-jbjm\nDescriptions: As part of our analysis, we want to visualize the impact of geography on dog ownership in New York City. To do this, we will leverage shapefiles made available by NYC Open Data. The first maps NYC zip codes to MultiPolygons. We can join this with our dog licensing data set which contains a column for zip code. The second spatial dataset maps NYC open spaces to Polygons. Open spaces include malls, parks, golf courses, and others. We will limit this dataset to just open spaces which can be utilized with dogs - namely these land use designations: “Flagship Park”, “Community Park”, “Neighborhood Park”, and “Nature Area”.\n\nDog Bite Dataset\n\nLink: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg/about_data\nDescription: One of the questions we posed in our introduction was whether dog bite rates have any effect on rates of dog ownership. To answer this question, we will use the Dog Bite Dataset from NYC Open Data. This data was collected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It is updated as needed and was last updated on February 21, 2024. The NYC Health Code requires all dog bites be reported within 24 hours. Data is received via website, mail, fax or by phone to 311. Each record represents a unique dog bite incident and contains information on dog breed, age, gender and spay/neuter status where available. We plan to import the data via the downloadable CSV on the NYC Open Data Website.\nOur analysis will primarily use this data source to construct counts of bites for different breeds of dogs. Unfortunately, it does not cover all years of our data, as the latest update was for 2022. We will use the range of years that matches to our data for analysis.\nThe data requires basic cleaning. For the dog breed and other characteristic variables, we code responses like “Not Provided” and “Unknown” as NA. We did discover that this dataset contains a high number of missing values for some of the dog characteristics. We will make note to avoid using these specific characteristics in our analysis.\n\nUS Census Bureau Data\n\nLink: https://data.census.gov/table?g=040XX00US36_050XX00US36005,36047&y=2023&d=ACS%201-Year%20Estimates%20Selected%20Population%20Profiles\nDescription: As mentioned in our introduction, we are looking to consider macro social factors and how they may relate to dog ownership. To inform this, we will leverage the latest US Census Bureau Data from 2023. We filter on the counties we are interested in - Staten Island, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, New York, Bronx. The Census Bureau collects data through variety of sources, including from respondents directly. It also uses existing data from government agencies and commercial entities. The data is released annually. Each column represents one of our selected counties and a demographic within the county (i.e. “Bronx Females”). There are seperate columns for value estimates, percent estimates, and margin of error. Each record represents a different characteristic of that demographic - for example “Median Household Income”. Using the Census Bureau website, we can filter the data and then export to CSV.\nThe dataset also includes a margin of error. Since census data is collected through a sampling method, the dataset provides us with an uncertainty level around the final estimate. Where necessary, we will include this margin of error in our final visualizations."

So, Staten Island is not considered in the demographic factor analysis, and we draw conclusions pertaining to the other four boroughs. As mentioned, each column represents a county and a demographic within the county. The rows are categorized into different demographic areas (age, household, etc.), and there are subcategories within larger categorizations. There are separate columns for values, percentages and margins of error. For simplicity, we are considering values and percentages without using margins of error in our analysis."

The data shows the years 2016-2023 with missing years from 2019-2021 due to COVID-19 and its effects on regular data collection in New York.\nSurprisingly, or unsurprisingly if any of your friends or loved ones got a dog in the height of the pandemic, there’s a significant spike in 2022.\n\n\nCode\ndog_license_data$BreedName[dog_license_data$BreedName == \"Unknown\"] &lt;- NA\ndog_license_data$BreedName[dog_license_data$BreedName == \"Not Provided\"] &lt;- NA\n\nnames(dog_license_data)[names(dog_license_data) == \"Extract Year\"] &lt;- \"Year\"\n\ndog_license_data &lt;- dog_license_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  mutate(unique_types = n_distinct(BreedName))\n\ncounts &lt;- dog_license_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n())\n\nownership &lt;- ggplot(counts, aes(x = factor(Year), y = count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#A6CEE3\") + \n  labs(title = \"Licenses Acquired by Year\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Count\", caption = \"Figure 1\") + \n  theme_minimal() \nownership\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the spike in 2022 is interesting, without counts from 2019-2021 it’s difficult to ascertain more specific causes of the spike. It could be delayed licensing of dogs acquired from 2019-2021, or it could be increased dog licensing in 2022. However, it is clear that overall dog licenses spiked in 2022 before returning to similar counts as prior to the pandemic.\nBy separating the counts over time by borough, it’s interesting to see how boroughs compare in dog ownership overall as well as year over year.\n\n\nCode\ncounts_zip &lt;- dog_license_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Year, ZipCode) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n())\n\ncounts_zip$borough &lt;- NA\ncounts_zip$borough[counts_zip$ZipCode &gt;= 10001 & counts_zip$ZipCode &lt;= 10128] &lt;- \"Manhattan\"\ncounts_zip$borough[counts_zip$ZipCode &gt;= 11004 & counts_zip$ZipCode &lt;= 11697] &lt;- \"Queens\"\ncounts_zip$borough[counts_zip$ZipCode &gt;= 11201 & counts_zip$ZipCode &lt;= 11239] &lt;- \"Brooklyn\"\ncounts_zip$borough[counts_zip$ZipCode &gt;= 10451 & counts_zip$ZipCode &lt;= 10474] &lt;- \"Bronx\"\ncounts_zip$borough[counts_zip$ZipCode &gt;= 10301 & counts_zip$ZipCode &lt;= 10314] &lt;- \"Staten Island\"\n\ncounts_borough &lt;- counts_zip |&gt;\n  group_by(Year, borough) |&gt;\n  summarise(totalcount = sum(count))\n\ncounts_borough_w_2020 &lt;- counts_borough |&gt;\n  bind_rows(data.frame(Year = 2020, borough = unique(counts_borough$borough), count = NA)) |&gt;\n  bind_rows(data.frame(Year = 2021, borough = unique(counts_borough$borough), count = NA)) |&gt;\n  arrange(borough, Year) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(borough))\n\n# Bar chart for count over years by borough\nborough_bar &lt;- ggplot(counts_borough_w_2020, aes(x = factor(Year), y = totalcount, fill = borough)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Count Over Years by Borough\",                    \n       x = \"Year\",                                                   \n       y = \"Count\",                                                \n       fill = \"Borough\", \n       caption = \"Figure 2\") +                                         \n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")\nborough_bar \n\n\n\n\n\nManhattan registered the most dog licenses each year by far, reaching a 5-year high in 2022 registering over 80,000 dogs, a number comparable to the population of the Upper West Side.

Other than the aforementioned spike in 2022, the counts remain relatively stable over the years across all of the boroughs."

Manhattan still seems to be the borough with the most love for dogs. The highest density neighborhoods appear to be on the Upper West Side and Lower West Side around Chelsea. The further north, the lower density of dogs seems to be as Harlem and the Bronx have lower dog-to-human ratios. The Bronx seems to possess a low density of dogs with the exception of its northeast corner. Surprisingly, Staten Island seems to have one of the next highest density of dogs, despite possessing the lowest count of dogs. While Brooklyn showed the second highest counts of dogs, there is density clustered around neighborhoods closer to lower Manhattan before dropping off quickly in the southern and eastern neighborhoods. The same density trend appears in Queens. Neighborhoods near Midtown Manhattan show higher dog ownership density that quickly dissipates as neighborhoods move further east.\nWhile interesting, this data does not show the same clear trends as the counts by borough showed. There’s clusters of denser dog ownership in each borough, and a generally high density in Manhattan neighborhoods compared to the other neighborhoods.\nMotivated by these findings, we delved deeper into the effect of urban planning and demographics on dog ownership in New York City in an attempt to explore the potential social factors of dog ownership in the city."

Particularly the Upper West Side which is surrounded both by Central Park to the East and Riverside Park to the West. There were some zip codes of Manhattan which did not fit the pattern. At the North tip of Manhattan are two large parks - Inwood Hill Park and Fort Tyron Park. However the zip codes surrounding these had relatively low numbers of licensed dogs.\nIn Brooklyn, the trend is equally apparent. Zip codes surrounding Prospect Park, the second largest park in Brooklyn, had the highest licensed dog populations. Zip codes surrounding the largest park, Marine Park, had slightly higher counts relative to surrounding neighborhoods in outer Brooklyn. There are also high-count neighborhoods surrounding Dyker Beach Park in South Brooklyn and Fort Greene Park in North Brooklyn.\nFrom these results, we concluded that proximity to green space is correlated to dog population. This is a logical conclusion as being close to a green space allows ease of walking and socializing your pet."

From our findings regarding green space and its correlation to dog ownership, we began asking questions about other social or demographic factors related to dog ownership.\nIn considering demographic factors that may affect dog ownership in New York City, we decided to investigate age first. Because dogs tend to be active, demanding pets to have in the household, we wanted to ascertain if the dominant age groups in any boroughs affected dog ownership trends in general ownership and breed.

In Brooklyn, 5 to 17 year olds, 35 to 44 year olds, and 45 to 54 year olds follow. In Queens, 5 to 17 year olds, 55 to 64 year olds, and 35 to 44 year olds follow. In the Bronx, 25 to 34 year olds, 35 to 44 year olds, and 55 to 64 year olds follow.\nThis could explain the trend seen above of lower density of dog ownership in many of the neighborhoods in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn compared to Manhattan. Young children, 5 to 17 year olds present in the top 2 age groups of each borough, do not usually have the resources to take care of dogs requiring food, walks, vet visits, etc. and require extensive resources themselves. So, it would make sense for many of these households to opt out of dog ownership."

We considered the proportion of family and nonfamily households in each borough first. By considering the proportion, we could better understand the makeup of each borough rather than the count of households.\n\n\nCode\nhouseholds_long &lt;- select(census_households, c(1, 3:6))[c(2:3, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14),]\nhouseholds_long &lt;- households_long |&gt;\n  rename(household_type = `Label (Grouping)`)\n\nhouseholds_long$`Bronx County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", households_long$`Bronx County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nhouseholds_long &lt;- households_long |&gt; rename(Bronx = `Bronx County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nhouseholds_long$`New York County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", households_long$`New York County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nhouseholds_long &lt;- households_long |&gt; rename(Manhattan = `New York County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nhouseholds_long$`Kings County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", households_long$`Kings County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nhouseholds_long &lt;- households_long |&gt; rename(Brooklyn = `Kings County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nhouseholds_long$`Queens County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", households_long$`Queens County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nhouseholds_long &lt;- households_long |&gt; rename(Queens = `Queens County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nhouseholds_long &lt;- households_long |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = `Bronx`:`Queens`, \n               names_to = \"Borough\", \n               values_to = \"Percentage\") \n\nhouseholds_long$household_type &lt;- str_squish(households_long$household_type)\n\nfamilyhouseholds &lt;- households_long[c(1:4,9:12),]\nfamilyhouseholds$Borough &lt;- as.factor(familyhouseholds$Borough)\nfamilyhouseholds$Borough &lt;- factor(familyhouseholds$Borough, levels = c(\"Manhattan\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Bronx\", \"Queens\"))\n\nhousehold_plot1 &lt;- ggplot(familyhouseholds, aes(x = Borough, y = Percentage, fill = household_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +  # Use actual values (percentage) for the bar heights\n  labs(\n    title = \"Family vs. Nonfamily Composition by Borough\",\n    x = \"Borough\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Households\",\n    caption = \"Figure 6\",\n    fill = \"Household Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Family households\" = \"#CAB2D6\", \n               \"Nonfamily households\" = \"#6A3D9A\"))\n\nhousehold_plot1\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, Manhattan clearly has a greater proportion of Nonfamily households compared to the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. This wide margin continues to show that Manhattan’s higher dog ownership density may be associated with having less households with children. However, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens have similar makeups, and the Bronx had generally less dog ownership density than both Brooklyn and Queens.\nLooking further into the composition of family and nonfamily households, nonfamily households were split into two categories, living alone and not living alone, and family households were split into two categories, with children and without children.\n\n\nCode\nwithoutchildren_bronx &lt;- households_long$Percentage[1] - households_long$Percentage[5]\nwithoutchildren_manhattan &lt;- households_long$Percentage[3] - households_long$Percentage[7]\nwithoutchildren_brooklyn &lt;- households_long$Percentage[2] - households_long$Percentage[6]\nwithoutchildren_queens &lt;- households_long$Percentage[4] - households_long$Percentage[8]\n\n# Create a new row with the calculated difference\nwithoutchildren_bronx &lt;- data.frame(household_type = \"Without Children\", Borough = \"Bronx\", Percentage = withoutchildren_bronx)\nwithoutchildren_manhattan &lt;- data.frame(household_type = \"Without Children\", Borough = \"Manhattan\", Percentage = withoutchildren_manhattan)\nwithoutchildren_brooklyn &lt;- data.frame(household_type = \"Without Children\", Borough = \"Brooklyn\", Percentage = withoutchildren_brooklyn)\nwithoutchildren_queens &lt;- data.frame(household_type = \"Without Children\", Borough = \"Queens\", Percentage = withoutchildren_queens)\n\n\n# Add the new row to the original data\nhouseholds_long &lt;- rbind(households_long, withoutchildren_bronx)\nhouseholds_long &lt;- rbind(households_long, withoutchildren_brooklyn)\nhouseholds_long &lt;- rbind(households_long, withoutchildren_manhattan)\nhouseholds_long &lt;- rbind(households_long, withoutchildren_queens)\n\nspecificfamily &lt;- households_long[c(5:8,13:32),]\nspecificfamily$Borough &lt;- as.factor(specificfamily$Borough)\nspecificfamily$Borough &lt;- factor(specificfamily$Borough, levels = c(\"Queens\", \"Bronx\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\"))\n\nspecificfamily &lt;- specificfamily|&gt;\n  group_by(Borough, household_type) |&gt;\n  summarize(Percentage = sum(Percentage), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nspecificfamily$household_type &lt;- str_squish(specificfamily$household_type)\n\nhousehold_plot2 &lt;- ggplot(specificfamily, aes(x = Borough, y = Percentage, fill = household_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Detailed Household Composition by Borough\",\n    x = \"Borough\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Households\",\n    fill = \"Household Type\",\n    caption = \"Figure 7\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")\nhousehold_plot2\n\n\n\n\n\nManhattan clearly contains the lowest percentage of households with children, followed by similar levels in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. While this may explain why more households in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens opt out of dog ownership, this data also shows an interesting trend in why some households in Manhattan may opt into dog ownership. Manhattan shows a large proportion of individuals living alone. They may be opting to own dogs for companionship or safety in these situations."

Queens and Brooklyn have comprable median incomes hovering around $75,000-$90,000 while the Bronx’s median income is under half of Manhattan’s, just under $50,000. This income disparity could explain the lower density in the Bronx, moderate density in Brooklyn and Queens, and much higher density in Manhattan. With more disposable income, there’s more money to put towards having pets and having enough space for pets in households.\nThis leads to more questions about what factors could distinguish ownership in the Bronx from ownership in Queens and Brooklyn, boroughs that still had some high density spots.\n\n\nCode\nincome_long &lt;- select(census_income, c(1, 3:6))[c(2:3, 5,7,9,11,13),]\nincome_long &lt;- income_long |&gt;\n  rename(income_type = `Label (Grouping)`)\n\nincome_long$`Bronx County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", income_long$`Bronx County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nincome_long &lt;- income_long |&gt; rename(Bronx = `Bronx County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nincome_long$`New York County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", income_long$`New York County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nincome_long &lt;- income_long |&gt; rename(Manhattan = `New York County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nincome_long$`Kings County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", income_long$`Kings County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nincome_long &lt;- income_long |&gt; rename(Brooklyn = `Kings County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nincome_long$`Queens County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", income_long$`Queens County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`))\nincome_long &lt;- income_long |&gt; rename(Queens = `Queens County, New York!!Total population!!Estimate`)\n\nincome_long &lt;- income_long |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = `Bronx`:`Queens`, \n               names_to = \"Borough\", \n               values_to = \"Percentage\") \n\nincome_long$Borough &lt;- as.factor(income_long$Borough)\nincome_long$Borough &lt;- factor(income_long$Borough, levels = c(\"Bronx\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Queens\", \"Manhattan\"))\n\nincome_percentage &lt;- income_long[c(5:28),]\n\nincome_plot &lt;- ggplot(income_percentage, aes(x = Borough, y = Percentage, fill = income_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +  # Use actual values (percentage) for the bar heights\n  labs(\n    title = \"Income Composition by Borough\",\n    x = \"Borough\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Income\",\n    fill = \"Income Type\",\n    caption = \"Figure 9\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")\nincome_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at income composition, the Bronx had two notable income types differing significantly from Brooklyn and Queens: public assistance income and Food Stamp/SNAP benefits.

In particular, individuals are not allowed to purchase pet food with these benefits. This further shows how income may explain the lower density of dogs in the Bronx despite similar household and age compositions in Brooklyn and Queens."

We defined “popular” as breeds representing greater than 2% of all dog licenses in New York City in a given year.

In other words, do these most popular dog breeds we see in the data correspond to any noticeable pattern in safety or behavior? To explore this question, we linked our dog license data to publically available data on reported dog bites in New York City. Looking at dog bite level per breed would not account for level differences in the number of dogs of a certain breed. So, we create a scaled measure of dog bite behavior with the following method. We scale the number of dog bites reported for each dog breed in a given year by the number of dog licenses in that year.

We supplemented our spatial analysis by looking at the relationship between dog ownership and proximity to green space. Given the apparent correlation between location and dog ownership, we next took a look at demographic and social characteristics by borough. Lastly, we constructed counts for the most popular dog breeds and dog names. We looked at dog bite-to-population rates for these most popular breeds.\nDog ownership was persistent across boroughs and time in New York City. Certain dog breeds and names were consistently popular. Overall, we noted that there seemed to be strong relationships between dog ownership and location. We also observed interesting age, household composition, and income trends in high dog ownership areas, though no direct causality could be established."
