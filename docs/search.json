    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn the world, dogs are one of the most popular household pets if not the most popular. New York City takes this popularity even further. Anecdotally, sometimes there seem to be more dogs on the street than people, and dog walking businesses are thriving. As three dog lovers living in New York, we aim to study the unique aspects of dog ownership and behaviors in this city. In addition, we hope to investigate the potential relationships between dogs in the city and social factors in the city such as public green space, income, living situations, and mental health.\nSpecifically, we plan to explore insights about the New York City dog population and dog owners. First, we’re interested in geographic and time series trends regarding various aspects of dog ownership such as the following questions: most popular dog breeds, average age of dog at adoption, most popular names in each zip code. Next, we aim to consider macro social factors and how they relate to dog ownership: are dog ownership and income level related? What about age, housing type, mental health status? Finally, our goal is to consider factors of the city and trends in dog ownership to ascertain potential aspects of living in New York City that relate to individuals owning dogs. Some of the questions we have: Do people feel safer with dogs in their home? Would areas with higher crime rates have more dog ownership? Do neighborhoods with more public green space lead to more dog ownership in those areas? Do dog bite rates in neighborhoods deter dog ownership? Are many dogs in New York City adopted or do more people purchase their dogs from breeders? Ultimately, we’re curious about the specific trends in dog ownership in New York City, what social factors may relate to owning a dog, as well as the way living in New York City may affect dog ownership trends.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nLink: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp/about_data\nDescription: Our primary data source will be the NYC Dog Licensing Dataset from NYC Open Data. This data is provided by the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene. The data is collected as part of the DOHMH Dog Licensing System, where all NYC dog owners are required to apply for dog licenses. The data is updated annually and was last updated on February 6th, 2024. Each record represents a unique dog license that was active during the year and contains columns for the animal name, gender, birth year, and breed. We plan to import the data via the downloadable CSV on the NYC Open Data Website.\nThis dataset requires minimal cleansing. However, we may want to define broader categories for the breeds of licensed dogs. For example, we may choose to group these two, “American Pit Bull Terrier/Pit Bull” and “American Pit Bull Mix/ Pit Bull Mix” into one breed “American Pit Bull”.\nLink: https://data.census.gov/table?g=040XX00US36_050XX00US36005,36047&y=2023&d=ACS%201-Year%20Estimates%20Selected%20Population%20Profiles\nDescription: As mentioned in our introduction, we are looking to consider macro social factors and how they may relate to dog ownership. To inform this, we will leverage the robust US Census Bureau Data, filtering by the counties we are interested in - Staten Island, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, New York, Bronx. The Census Bureau collects data through variety of sources, including from respondents directly. It also uses existing data from government agencies and commercial entities. The data is released annually. Each column represents one of our selected counties and a demographic within the county (i.e. “Bronx Females). There are seperate columns for value estimates, percent estimates, and margin of error. Each record represents a different characteristic of that demographic - for example”Median Household Income”. Using the Census Bureau website, we can filter the data and then export to CSV.\nThe dataset also includes a margin of error. Since census data is collected through a sampling method, the dataset provides us with an uncertainty level around the final estimate. Where necessary, we will include this margin of error in our final visualizations.\nLink: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg/about_data\nDescription: One of the questions we posed in our introduction was whether dog bite rates have any effect on rates of dog ownership. To answer this question, we will use the Dog Bite Dataset from NYC Open Data. This data was collected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It is updated as needed and was last updated on February 21, 2024. The NYC Health Code requires all dog bites be reported within 24 hours. Data is received via website, mail, fax or by phone to 311. Each record represents a unique dog bite incident and contains information on dog breed, age, gender and spay/neuter status where available. We plan to import the data via the downloadable CSV on the NYC Open Data Website.\nWe did discover that this dataset contains a high number of missing values for some of the dog characteristics. We will make note to avoid using these specific characteristics in our analysis.",

    "text": "To begin our analysis, we explored dog ownership trends over time to draw conclusions on the growth of New York City’s dog population in relation to cultural shifts and world events.\n*TO-DO\nIn this portion of our analysis, we explored New York City’s dog population spatially to draw conclusions about the impact of geography on population characteristics.\n\n\nCode\ndog_license_count_by_zip &lt;- dog_license_data |&gt; \n  group_by(ZipCode) |&gt; \n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(count)) |&gt; \n  mutate(ZipCode = as.character(ZipCode))\n\nzip_sf_with_dog_count &lt;- zip_code_sf |&gt; \n  left_join(dog_license_count_by_zip, by=\"ZipCode\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = zip_sf_with_dog_count, aes(fill=count)) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(name = \"Number of Dog Licenses\", palette = \"Blues\", direction = 1) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(color=\"transparent\")) + \n  labs(title = \"What NYC neighborhoods have high dog ownership?\", caption = \"Figure 1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 1, we observe that the zip codes with high counts of licensed dogs tend to be in or in close proximity to Manhattan. It’s important to note that these neighborhoods also have the highest human populations. The highest density zip code appears on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, a largely residential neighborhood. Population remains high in most of midtown and lower Manhattan, but is lower in Upper Manhattan. This trend is similar in Brooklyn. Neighborhoods closest to lower and midtown Manhattan have a high count of licensed dogs while neighborhoods deeper into Brooklyn and in Queens tend to have lower counts. Neighborhoods in central Staten Island showed a high count of licensed dogs as well. This graph, and in particular our observation on the Upper West Side, provoked us to ask another question. In the next figure, we explore the impact of green spaces on licensed dog population.\n\n\nCode\nmanhattan_boundary &lt;- borough_boundaries_sf |&gt; \n  filter(boro_name == \"Manhattan\")\n\nzip_sf_manhattan &lt;- st_intersection(zip_sf_with_dog_count, manhattan_boundary)\n\nopen_spaces_sf_manhattan &lt;- st_intersection(st_make_valid(open_spaces_sf), manhattan_boundary)\n\nmanhattan_plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = zip_sf_manhattan, aes(fill=count)) +\n  geom_sf(fill =  \"#99ff66\", data = open_spaces_sf_manhattan) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(name = \"Number of Dog Licenses\", palette = \"Greys\", direction = 1) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(color=\"transparent\")) + \n  labs(title = \"Manhattan\")\n\nbrooklyn_boundary &lt;- borough_boundaries_sf |&gt; \n  filter(boro_name == \"Brooklyn\")\n\nzip_sf_brooklyn &lt;- st_intersection(zip_sf_with_dog_count, brooklyn_boundary)\n\nopen_spaces_sf_brooklyn &lt;- st_intersection(st_make_valid(open_spaces_sf), brooklyn_boundary)\n\nbrooklyn_plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = zip_sf_brooklyn, aes(fill=count)) +\n  geom_sf(fill = \"#99ff66\", data = open_spaces_sf_brooklyn) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(name = \"Number of Dog Licenses\", palette = \"Greys\", direction = 1) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(color=\"transparent\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Brooklyn\")\n\n(manhattan_plot | brooklyn_plot) +\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Does proximity to green space affect dog ownership?\", caption = \"Figure 2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 led us to conclude that proximity to green space is correlated to dog population. In Manhattan, zip codes surrounding Central Park displayed the highest licensed dog population. Particularly the Upper West Side which is surrounded both by Central Park to the East and Riverside Park to the West. There were some zip codes of Manhattan which did not fit the pattern. At the North tip of Manhattan is two large parks - Inwood Hill Park and Fort Tyron Park. However the zip codes surrounding these had relatively low numbers of licensed dogs. In Brooklyn, the trend is equally apparent. Zip codes surrounding Prospect Park, the second largest park in Brooklyn, had the highest licensed dog populations. Zip codes surrounding the largest park, Marine Park, had higher counts relative to surrounding neighborhoods in outer Brooklyn. There are also high count neighborhoods surrounding Dyker Beach Park in South Brooklyn and Fort Greene Park in North Brooklyn. These observations proved our hypothesis to be true that proximity to a green space encourages dog ownership. This is a logical conclusion as being close to a green space allows ease of walking and socializing your pet. As we showed in the above two figures, geography has an impact on rates of dog ownership. We further wondered, does geography affect the most popular dog breeds?\n#TODO: Clean up Dog Breed Names (merge similar) & write analysis\n\n\nCode\ndog_license_breed_count_by_borough &lt;- dog_license_data |&gt;
