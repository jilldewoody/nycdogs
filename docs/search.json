Provide context for readers who are not familiar with the topic.\nIn the world, dogs are one of the most popular household pets if not the most popular. New York City takes this popularity even further. Anecdotally, sometimes there seem to be more dogs on the street than people, and dog walking businesses are thriving. As three dog lovers living in New York, we aim to study the unique aspects of dog ownership and behaviors in this city. In addition, we hope to investigate the potential relationships between dogs in the city and social factors in the city such as public green space, income, living situations, and mental health."
